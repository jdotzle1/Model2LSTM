# Feature Engineering Test Suite

## Overview
`test_features_comprehensive.py` provides comprehensive testing for the feature engineering system with minimal code (156 lines).

## Test Coverage

### Unit Tests (Requirements 15.1)
- **Volume Features (4)**: Tests volume ratios, slopes, and exhaustion signals
- **Price Context Features (5)**: Tests VWAP, distances, and session levels
- **Consolidation Features (10)**: Tests range calculations and retouch counting
- **Return Features (5)**: Tests momentum calculations at multiple timeframes
- **Volatility Features (6)**: Tests ATR calculations and regime detection
- **Microstructure Features (6)**: Tests bar characteristics and tick flow
- **Time Features (7)**: Tests session period identification (binary encoding)

### Integration Tests (Requirements 15.2)
- **End-to-End Processing**: Validates complete pipeline adds exactly 43 features
- **Data Preservation**: Ensures original columns and row count are maintained
- **Feature Names**: Validates all expected feature names are present

### Data Leakage Tests (Requirements 15.3)
- **Future Data Prevention**: Tests that features at bar N only use data from bars 0 to N-1
- **Temporal Validation**: Injects future spikes and verifies they don't affect past features
- **Chronological Consistency**: Ensures features reflect changes in proper time order

### Performance Tests (Requirements 15.4)
- **Processing Speed**: Validates minimum processing rate (â‰¥10 bars/second)
- **Memory Efficiency**: Tests on 2K bars to estimate larger dataset performance
- **Scalability Notes**: Documents chunked processing for production datasets

### Validation Tests (Requirements 15.5)
- **Range Validation**: Checks features fall within expected ranges
- **Data Quality**: Validates no infinite values or extreme outliers
- **Binary Features**: Ensures time features are properly encoded as 0/1
- **Percentage Features**: Validates uptick percentages are in [0,100] range

## Usage

```bash
# Run comprehensive test suite
python tests/test_features_comprehensive.py

# Expected output: All tests pass with validation messages
```

## Test Data
- Uses synthetic OHLCV data with realistic ES futures characteristics
- Creates controlled scenarios for data leakage testing
- Generates sufficient data for rolling window calculations

## Performance Notes
- Retouch calculations are computationally expensive but necessary for accuracy
- Production systems use chunked processing for memory efficiency
- Test validates core functionality rather than full-scale performance
