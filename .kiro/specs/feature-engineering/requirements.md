# Feature Engineering Requirements Document

## Introduction

Implement a comprehensive feature engineering system for ES futures trading that generates 42 features across 7 categories as defined in #[[file:docs/feature_definitions.md]] and summarized in #[[file:docs/feature_summary.md]]. The system must process datasets ranging from 947K bars (laptop testing) to 88M bars (15 years of production data on SageMaker) while maintaining perfect data integrity, preventing future data leakage, and optimizing for LSTM model training. The resulting dataset will be used to train an LSTM neural network with 6 output heads (one for each trading profile) to predict optimal entry timing for ES futures trades.
